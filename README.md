# analytics-notebooks
A bunch of data analytics notebooks done with (JetBrains DataLore)[https://datalore.jetbrains.com]
The .ipynb is the exported Jupyter Notebook, .html is the exported rendering
from Datalore, and .py contains the code in plain Python.

## ai-algorithms
University of Helsinki / Reactor Building AI - Advanced Honors Python
workbook. As I was making my way through the (course)[https://buildingai.elementsofai.com],
I kept a Jupyter notebook of the tasks. I completed the course
assignments with Advanced Honors.

The included code can be a useful starting point for developing AI and
machine learning algorithms.

## economic-analysis
Notebook WIP analysis, won't likely see much progress since I can't remember
what I was going to analyze with this. Think it was mainly about scraping data
from the web, particularly World Fact Book, as it has a ton of interesting data.

## helsinki-university-data-analytics
Notebook for a WIP open data analytics course I started for fun. Might finish
the course one day.

## solita-trains
A "coding test" for a Finnish company I once applied to. Ended up running out of
time due to some technical challenges, but still got an offer.

## trade-analysis
A simple trade analysis from the U.S. perspective, showing that when comparing
trade partners, it would make sense to use per capita. For example, Finland is
a small country, and it would seem that there's a trade deficit, which some take
to imply Finland is taking advantage of the USA, shipping more items to America,
while not buying from America. However, if you take in the fact that USA has
hundreds of millions of people, while Finland has 5 million, when adjusted per
capita the results are the opposite: A Finn spends way more on U.S. goods than
an American spends on Finnish!
